// I like what I have done here,
// but there are few things that I would like to improve.
/*
0. As of right now, the quit feature is not working optimally, so
 I need to get that working correctly because I currently have to
 ctrl c to quit.
1. I would like to center the initial questions on the console, and
wrap them with box to make it look a little more professional.
2. I would also like to add a progression bar by using a
simple wrap border box and filling it with stars which would
increase with every question answered. So the length of
the box would be the number of total questions and another star
 would add after the user answers a question which would give
  the effect of a progress bar.
3. I would also like to clear the console after every question
 as opposed to having every question stacked on top of each other
  until the end of the page which is also needed because as I said before,
   I wanted to have the each question wrapped in a box border.

Likes
1. I like how I have the article finder function that
will look to see if the word starts with a vowel and
if it does then it will return a "an" instead of an "a".
2. I think it was also a good idea to have the variables saved into
 a number that corresponds to the blank spot to make constructing
 the text box more clear and easier.
